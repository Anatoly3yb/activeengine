# Active Engine authors

Active Engine is developed by a community of voluntary contributors who
contribute code, bug reports, documentation, artwork, support, etc.

It is impossible to list them all; nevertheless, this file aims at listing
the developers who contributed significant patches to this MIT licensed
source code. "Significant" is arbitrarily decided, but should be fair :)

GitHub usernames are indicated in parentheses, or as sole entry when no other
name is available.
